      <img src="IMAGES/profile-picture.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">
      <p>Hello! My name is Steven Cantando. I am from Springfield, Pennsylvania, and I am 24
        years old. I currently work for a Logistics company called Expeditors. My duties include receiving,
        handling and documenting the shipments that come through our warehouse, and routing them to the
        correct customers.
    <br> 
        My hobbies
        include listening to music, as well as playing it. I love all of the percussion instruments!
        My
        favorite
        band, for many reasons, is The Red Hot Chili Peppers. This band also includes my favorite
        drummer!
        I
        have seen the band four times in concert, and hope to see them four more!</p>

    <p>As much as music means to me, my first love was always hockey. I played competitive hockey
        for 18
        years. I am now moved on from the competitive playing aspect of the sport, but still find
        ways
        to
        incorporate
        hockey into my everyday life. Whether it is watching NHL games, to coaching minor hockey, to
        playing
        for fun,
        the sport will always be more than a game to me.
